#partition
1. Master Boot Record (446 bytes)
2. partition table (64bytes)
    Because the partition table has only 64bytes, it can at most devide the disk into 4 partitions, which we call "primary" or "extended" partitions. We can have at most 4(primary+extended)partions, at most 1 extended partition. The logical partition(s) are derived from the extended partition.
#MBR&&loader
1. If someone wants to install both windows and linux OS on his computer, he is recommended to first install windows and then linux. Beacause when installing linux, you can manually chose where to install the linux-boot-loader, in MBR partition or other partitions. While the windows installing program will automatically cover the previous MBR partition, thus the previous installed linux OS is unable to be loaded.
#directory tree
1. root directory /
    | /boot | /dev | /etc | /bin | /home | /usr | /var | ...

    '..' means above directory
    '-' means last directory

## JFS (journing file sysytem)

hard link: add a filename, linking to the indentical inode, can't link to a directory

symbolic link: add a new file, the new file is used for recording the linked filename, can be linked to a directory.
